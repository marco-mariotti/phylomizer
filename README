PhylomeDB pipeline.

Here we present the PhylomeDB pipeline called "phylomizer" which has been used to generate more than 4 millions trees hosted at phylomedb.org.

This pipeline comprises the steps followed by traditional phylogeneticists: 1) Search of homologous sequences, 2) Reconstruction of multiple sequence alignment, and 3) Inference of phylogenetic trees.

Please check wiki section for getting a better overview about this pipeline as well as the two main configuration used in the phylomes generation

### This fork is to test the phylomizer_wrapper.py script, in order to include something similar in the main package.  Note: currently this script uses a few functions from MMlib
### please run: "python phylomizer_wrapper.py -print_opt -h "  to see the help page as well as default options, which are pointing to resources in the CRG network.
